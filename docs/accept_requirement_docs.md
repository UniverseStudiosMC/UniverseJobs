# ACCEPT

Provides custom rewards and feedback when requirements are successfully met.

## Description

Accept requirements define what happens when a condition is **successfully met**. They work together with deny requirements to provide complete control over both success and failure scenarios, allowing you to reward players and provide positive feedback.

## Basic Configuration

```yaml
requirements:
  permission:
    permission: "jobs.vip"
    accept:
      message: "&aVIP access granted!"
      sound: "ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP"
      commands:
