# BIOME

Restricts actions to specific biomes or excludes certain biomes.

## Description

Biome requirements check the current biome where the player is located to allow or restrict job actions. Perfect for creating biome-specific professions, environmental jobs, or location-based activities that make ecological sense.

## Basic Configuration

```yaml
requirements:
  biome:
    biomes: 
      - "FOREST"
      - "DARK_FOREST"
      - "BIRCH_FOREST"
    blacklist: false  # false = whitelist (allow only these), true = blacklist (deny these)
    deny:
      message: "&cThis action requires a forest biome!"
      sound: "ENTITY_VILLAGER_NO"
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `biomes` | List | [] | List of Minecraft biome names |
| `blacklist` | Boolean | false | false = whitelist mode, true = blacklist mode |
