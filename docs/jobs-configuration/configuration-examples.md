## üéØ Configuration Tips

### XP Curve Balancing
```yaml
# Slow and steady progression
xp-equation: "100 * Math.pow(level, 1.2)"

# Fast start, slower later
xp-equation: "50 * Math.pow(level, 1.8) + level * 25"

# Very difficult for prestige jobs
xp-equation: "200 * Math.pow(level, 2.5)"
```

### Complex Conditions
```yaml
requirements:
  logic: "AND"
  # Must have permission AND be in right world
  permission:
    permission: "vip.mining"
  world:
    worlds: ["mining_world"]
  # AND have certain level OR special item
  groups:
    group1:
      logic: "OR"
      placeholder:
        placeholder: "%jobsadventure_miner_player_level%"
        operator: "greater_than"
        value: "50"
      item:
        mmoitems:
          type: "TOOL"
          id: "MASTER_PICKAXE"
```

### Dynamic Messages
```yaml
# Different messages based on level
message:
  type: "BOSSBAR"
  color: "GREEN"
  duration: 60
  # Using placeholders
  message: "&a+{exp} XP {job} &7| Total: %jobsadventure_{job}_player_xp%"
